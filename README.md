# Welcome Guys!

This is my first Web3 app! As a **Bug Bounty Hunter** and **Developer**, I have now migrated into the Web3 space. After spending some time understanding the key concepts, I was able to build my first **Hybrid Smart Contract** and this accompanying app. 

### Why I Built This App

This project isn't about fancy UI/UX; itâ€™s about the **smart contracts** I developed and deployed. My goal was to create a functional decentralized application to showcase my expertise in smart contract development, leveraging the knowledge I've gained through the **Solidity** and **Ethereum** courses I've taken.

### Key Highlights

The core functionality of this application revolves around two smart contracts: a **caller contract** and an **oracle contract**.

1. **Caller Contract**: The user interacts with the caller contract to trigger a request for hacker data.
   
2. **Oracle Contract**: Upon receiving the request, the caller contract communicates with the oracle contract, which gathers the necessary data from external data providers.

3. **Data Fetch and Update**: The oracle contract fetches the hacker data and sends it back to the caller contract. The caller contract processes the data, updates the hacker information, and sorts it to maintain a dynamic leaderboard.



### Smart Contracts Location

The smart contracts are located in the following path:


Feel free to explore the contract code to see the implementation details of this Web3 application!

### Special Thanks
A big shoutout to the **boilerplate** that provided the foundational template for this project. It made the development process smoother and allowed me to focus on learning and implementing smart contracts.

### What's Next?

I'm excited to keep learning and improving, both in Web3 development and bug bounty hunting. Thanks for checking out my first Web3 project!
